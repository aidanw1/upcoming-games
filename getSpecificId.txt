How to get details of a game
. each game 
. api accepts an id at the end which we will dynamically pass in
export const gameDetailsURL = (game_id) => `${base_url}games/${game_id}`;
. pass in an id to the action you are creating
. axios.get request - the id argument from loadDetail gets passed in to the url
. when we dispatch the loadDetail action thats when we will pass
 in the game id which is being mapped over for each item
 dispatch(loadDetail(game.id))
export const loadDetail = (id) => async (dispatch) => {
//passes in an id from the action
  const detailData = await axios.get(gameDetailsURL(id));

  dispatch({
    type: "GET_DETAIL",
    payload: {
      game: detailData.data,
    },
  });
};
